We will be having the probabilities of the old dices.

So in the first step we will be calculating the all possible combinations for the both dices possible.
After getting all the possible combinations we will be calculation the probabilities for each pair of lists.

If we get the probabilities equal then those are the pairs we are looking for.

We will be using two for loops to get the probability calculated and check the probabilities calculated with the old probabilities.
